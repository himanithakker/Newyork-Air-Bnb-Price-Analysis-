# Newyork-Air-Bnb-Price-Analysis-

Problem Definition:

Since its beginning in 2008, Airbnb has seen enormous growth, with the number of rentals listed on its website and is growing exponentially since. We know that one of the most popular cities to visit in the United States is New York City. Itâ€™s widely known for the richness of its five boroughs namely, Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island. Our dataset contains information about the availability of an Airbnb in a particular Area with other information. Through this project, we attempt to analyze the trends to understand customer preferences for selecting an Airbnb over other hotels for long-term stay, on the basis of pricing, location, availability, reviews, and hosting services.

Prospective Business Rules:

1.	Predict the availability of an Airbnb in all five boroughs based on basis of Price and Host Reviews.
2.	Which Neighbourhood generated the maximum and minimum revenues in terms of Room type?
3.	Determine the most popular Neighbourhood in Manhattan? Analyze the trend based onprices.
4.	Find the availability of a particular Room type in each Borough.
5.	Which Hosts are the busiest and why? How can I find one super host in each Neighbourhood on the basis of Host Reviews?
